# AdoptSense — Pet Adoption Speed Prediction

End-to-end machine learning pipeline predicting how quickly a pet listed on PetFinder will be adopted (same day to never), built on the Kaggle PetFinder.my dataset. The trained pipeline powers a Streamlit frontend for live predictions.

## Project Overview

AdoptSense trains an XGBoost multi-class classifier on ~15,000 labelled pet listings to predict one of five adoption speed classes:

| Class | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Same day | Adopted on the day of listing |
| 1 | 1-7 days | Adopted within the first week |
| 2 | 8-30 days | Adopted within the first month |
| 3 | 31-90 days | Adopted within three months |
| 4 | No adoption | Not adopted after 100 days |

The notebook (`src/petadoption_run.ipynb`) covers the full analytical pipeline from EDA through to a saved, production-ready pickle. The test set from Kaggle contains no labels and is not used for evaluation; all validation is done on a stratified hold-out split of the labelled training data.

---

## Key Findings

From the EDA and model feature importance:

- **Photos are the single strongest factor.** Listings with no photos have a 60%+ probability of Speed 4 (no adoption). The effect plateaus after 3 to 5 photos.
- **Age drives adoption speed more than any other numeric feature.** Puppies and kittens (1 to 3 months) adopt fastest; pets over two years adopt significantly slower.
- **Fee is a barrier.** Free adoptions skew strongly toward faster speeds.
- **All linear correlations with AdoptionSpeed are below 0.10**, confirming that a non-linear tree-based model is the right choice.
- **Description sentiment matters.** Listings with a more positive tone tend toward faster adoption, even after controlling for other features.
- **Health and sterilisation** show counterintuitive patterns: listings marked as healthy dominate the dataset (low discriminative power), and non-sterilised pets show faster adoption in the data.
- **Geography:** Selangor and Kuala Lumpur account for ~85% of listings; Pahang and Johor adopt faster than average.

## Model

**Algorithm:** XGBoost multi-class classifier (`multi:softmax`, 5 classes)

**Hyperparameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| `n_estimators` | 300 |
| `max_depth` | 6 |
| `learning_rate` | 0.1 |
| `subsample` | 0.8 |
| `colsample_bytree` | 0.8 |
| `random_state` | 42 |

**Validation metrics (Section 3.1 output):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.3991 |
| Macro F1 | 0.3461 |
| Weighted F1 | 0.3877 |
| Macro Precision | 0.4738 |
| Macro Recall | 0.3362 |

**Evaluation metrics:** Accuracy, Macro F1, Weighted F1, Macro Precision, Macro Recall, per-class F1, ROC curves (one-vs-rest), Precision-Recall curves, confusion matrices.

Macro F1 is used as the primary selection metric because it weights all five classes equally, penalising poor performance on minority classes (especially Speed 0, which represents only 2.7% of the data). Class weights are applied during training to partially counteract the imbalance.

**Validation:** Stratified train/validation split (80/20). Stratification preserves the class distribution in both sets, giving a reliable generalisation estimate without access to labelled test data.

## Feature Engineering

`TabularFeatures` (`src/features_tabular.py`) produces 27 features from the raw listing DataFrame. In the notebook run captured in `src/petadoption_run.ipynb`, an additional 10 Google NLP JSON sentiment features are appended during modeling, producing a 37-column analytical matrix. All features are integer-encoded; the StandardScaler is applied to numeric columns selected from that matrix (scaling has no effect on XGBoost predictions since tree-based models are scale-invariant).

**Structural features (23):**

| Group | Features |
|---|---|
| Raw numerics | `Age`, `PhotoAmt`, `Fee`, `VideoAmt`, `Quantity` |
| Binary flags | `has_photo`, `has_video`, `is_free`, `has_name` |
| Ordinal bins | `age_bin`, `photo_bin`, `desc_bin` |
| Description | `desc_word_count` |
| Categoricals | `Type`, `Gender`, `MaturitySize`, `FurLength`, `Vaccinated`, `Dewormed`, `Sterilized`, `Health`, `Color1`, `State` |

**VADER sentiment features (4):**

Computed inline from the `Description` string by `TabularFeatures` using the NLTK VADER lexicon — offline, instant, no API required:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `sentiment_compound` | Overall polarity score (-1 to +1) |
| `sentiment_pos` | Fraction of text with positive tone |
| `sentiment_neg` | Fraction of text with negative tone |
| `sentiment_neu` | Fraction of text with neutral tone |

---

## Sentiment Analysis

Two sentiment approaches were evaluated in the notebook. The final pipeline uses VADER.

### Google NLP JSON (analytical only)

The Kaggle dataset includes pre-computed Google Cloud Natural Language API JSON files for 96.3% of training pets (14,442 out of 14,993). These provide 10 richer features: document score, document magnitude, sentence-level ratios, entity count, and entity salience.

Section 3.4 of the notebook uses these features for an ablation test (27-feature baseline vs 37-feature enhanced), confirming they add signal:

| Metric | Baseline (27) | Enhanced (+JSON, 37) | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Accuracy | 0.3931 | 0.3991 | +0.0060 |
| Macro F1 | 0.3314 | 0.3461 | +0.0147 |
| Weighted F1 | 0.3809 | 0.3877 | +0.0068 |
| Macro Precision | 0.4115 | 0.4738 | +0.0623 |
| Macro Recall | 0.3263 | 0.3362 | +0.0099 |

Section 3.5 then runs a direct head-to-head comparison against VADER-only features.

### VADER (deployed pipeline)

In the head-to-head test (Section 3.5 output), VADER and Google NLP JSON trade off metrics:

| Approach | Feature Count | Accuracy | Macro F1 | Weighted F1 | Macro Precision | Macro Recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| VADER-only | 27 | 0.3931 | 0.3314 | 0.3809 | 0.4115 | 0.3263 |
| Google NLP JSON-only | 33 | 0.3995 | 0.3304 | 0.3879 | 0.4005 | 0.3278 |

VADER was selected by Macro F1 in that comparison and for the deployment practicality reason: Google NLP JSON files exist only for the training corpus. For new frontend listings, no pre-computed JSON exists. The alternatives are calling Google Cloud NLP at inference time (latency, cost, external dependency) or zero-filling JSON features (discarding the intended signal). VADER is computed directly from the description string - offline, fast, and reproducible in production.

## Source Modules

### `src/config.py`

Frozen dataclass holding all filesystem paths and training constants. Import once and pass `cfg` through the notebook:

```python
from src.config import Config
cfg = Config()
```

Key constants: `RANDOM_STATE = 42`, `TEST_SIZE = 0.2`, `TARGET_COL = "AdoptionSpeed"`.

### `src/features_tabular.py`

`TabularFeatures` — stateless feature transformer. Handles missing value imputation, binary flag creation, ordinal binning, and VADER sentiment scoring. No fit step; safe to reuse across train, validation, and inference.

```python
from src.features_tabular import TabularFeatures
fe = TabularFeatures()
X = fe.feature_engineering_tabular(df)   # returns 27-column DataFrame
```

### `src/features_sentiment.py`

`SentimentFeatures` — loads Google NLP JSON files for the training corpus. Used analytically in the notebook (Sections 3.4 and 3.5) but not included in the deployed pipeline.

```python
from src.features_sentiment import SentimentFeatures, SENTIMENT_FEATURE_COLS
sf = SentimentFeatures(cfg.TRAIN_SENTIMENT_DIR)
sent_df = sf.load_for_ids(df["PetID"])
df = df.merge(sent_df, on="PetID", how="left")
```

### `src/features_text.py`

Stub module reserved for future transformer-based or TF-IDF text features. Current description sentiment is handled by VADER inside `TabularFeatures`.

### `src/features_image_meta.py`

Stub module reserved for image quality or metadata features (CNNs, image scoring). Not used in the current pipeline.

## Data Setup

Download the dataset from the [PetFinder.my Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction) and place the files as shown below. Do not commit anything under `data/`.

```
data/
├── train/
│   ├── train.csv
│   ├── train_images/
│   ├── train_metadata/
│   └── train_sentiment/      # required for Sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the notebook
├── test/
│   ├── test.csv
│   └── ...
├── breed_labels.csv
├── color_labels.csv
└── state_labels.csv
```

The `train_sentiment/` directory is needed for the Google NLP JSON analytical sections. Without it, those sections are skipped gracefully and the VADER-based pipeline (Sections 2 onwards) runs without issue.
